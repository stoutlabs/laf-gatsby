# LetaAustinFoster.com - Gatsby Website

Source code for the 2018 update of LetaAustinFoster.com. I am sharing the full source here in hopes that it might help others looking to create similar websites!

I am fully aware that the code is a bit messy (read: dumpster fire-ish) in places, so I apologize in advance. :sweat_smile:

- Built with [Gatsby](http://www.gatsbyjs.org), Styled Components, a sprinkling of Bulma, and a tiny bit of redux
- Features a custom thumbnail gallery component, which makes use of react-css-transition-replace and gatsby-image. (I couldn't find an existing one that did what I wanted, so I built my own.)
- Uses Prismic.io to provide content
- Hosted/deployed via Netlify.com (with continuous integration)

---

#### To-Do List:

- After the Gatsby v2 official release, I plan to migrate the site over to that. (I will add better page transitions at that point, too.)
- Use Kyle Mathew's [typefaces](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typefaces) library to load font(s) locally... which should shave more load time off
- Definitely planning to create a Gatsby plugin/npm package from the 'thumbnail gallery' component I built

#### Prismic JSON Schemas

I will post these soon! (Once the site goes live.)

#### Sidenote:

- _**Confession:** I'm new to the neighborhood. I just recently moved here from the strange/antiquated land of PHP. The land of JS is wonderful, though... and I have no plans to go back!_
