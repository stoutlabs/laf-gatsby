Upcoming LetaAustinFoster.com JAMstack website. I am sharing the full source here in hopes that it can help others looking to create similar websites! I am fully aware that the code is a bit messy (read: dumpster fire-ish) in places, so I apologize in advance.

-  Built with Gatsby, Styled Components, a sprinkling of Bulma, and a tiny bit of redux
-  Features a custom React thumbnail gallery component, which makes use of react-css-transition-replace and gatsby-image. (I couldn't find an existing one that did what I wanted, so I built my own.)
-  Uses Prismic.io to provide content
-  Hosted/deployed via Netlify, with Continuous Integration (CI)

### Sidenote:

I also apologize for the lack of PropTypes. I plan to start implementing them soon, though! (_Confession: I'm new to the neighborhood. I just recently moved here from the strange/antiquated land of PHP. The land of JS is wonderful, though... and I have no plans to go back!_)
