Upcoming LetaAustinFoster.com website upgrade to JAMstack tech. I am sharing the full source here in hopes that it can help others looking to create similar websites! I am fully aware that the code is a bit messy (read: dumpster fire-ish) in places, so I apologize in advance.

- Built with Gatsby, Styled Components, a sprinkling of Bulma, and a tiny bit of redux
- Features a custom React thumbnail gallery component, which makes use of react-css-transition-replace and gatsby-image. (I couldn't find an existing one that did what I wanted, so I built my own.)
- Uses Prismic.io to provide content
- Hosted/deployed via Netlify.com (with continuous integration)

---

### Currently:

- Debating on migrating the site to Gatsby v2(beta), so that I can make use of page transitions without jumping thru flaming hoops. (I am reluctant becuse it's still in beta, though... and I experienced a few breaking changes & dependency mismatches while building stoutlabs.com with v2.)

---

#### Sidenote:

- I will post the Prismic JSON schemas here after the site goes live.

- _**Confession:** I'm new to the neighborhood. I just recently moved here from the strange/antiquated land of PHP. The land of JS is wonderful, though... and I have no plans to go back!_
